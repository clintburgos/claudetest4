# Isometric Grid Project Summary

## Overview
This project implements a minimal isometric grid system with pan and zoom capabilities. The design prioritizes simplicity, clear responsibilities, and testability over features and optimizations.

## Design Philosophy

### Why This Architecture?
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has exactly one responsibility
   - `IsometricGrid`: Pure math for coordinate transformations
   - `Camera`: Viewport state management (position and zoom)
   - `GridRenderer`: Canvas drawing operations
   - `IsometricViewport`: Orchestration of the above components

2. **No Premature Optimization**: The MVP intentionally excludes:
   - Culling (draws everything, even off-screen tiles)
   - Batching (each tile is drawn individually)
   - Caching (full redraw every frame)
   - Texture atlases or sprite management
   - Complex input handling

3. **Test-Driven Development**: Small, testable units allow for:
   - Easy verification of coordinate math
   - Mocking of canvas operations
   - Isolation of components during testing
   - Confidence in refactoring

4. **Simple Contracts**: Each public method has a clear input/output:
   - No side effects in transformation methods
   - Immutable coordinate objects
   - Predictable state changes

## Key Learnings from Research

### Coordinate Mathematics
- Standard isometric uses 2:1 tile ratio (width = 2 × height)
- Grid to screen: `x' = (x-y) * w/2, y' = (x+y) * h/2`
- Screen to grid: Inverse matrix transformation
- Must use floating-point math for precision

### Common Pitfalls Avoided
1. **Tile Bleeding**: Not relevant for our simple shape drawing
2. **Depth Sorting**: Not needed - we just draw a flat grid
3. **Mouse Picking**: Simplified by proper coordinate transformation
4. **Performance**: Ignored in favor of simplicity

### Technology Choices
- **Plain TypeScript**: No game engine overhead
- **Canvas 2D**: Simpler than WebGL for basic shapes
- **Jest**: Familiar testing framework
- **No Dependencies**: Everything built from scratch

## MVP Scope

### What's Included
- Draw infinite grid of diamond-shaped tiles
- Pan by dragging mouse
- Zoom with mouse wheel
- Convert between grid and screen coordinates
- ~180 lines of production code

### What's Explicitly Excluded
- Textures or images
- Different tile types
- Tile selection/highlighting
- Smooth animations
- Touch support
- Grid boundaries
- Save/load functionality
- Multiple layers
- Entity system
- Pathfinding
- Any game logic

## Quick Start for AI Agents

To understand this codebase:
1. Read `isometric-grid-design.md` for architecture
2. Review `implementation-plan.md` for build order
3. Check `isometric-world-grid-guide.md` sections 1-2 for math
4. Ignore optimization sections - this is an MVP

Key principle: **Every line of code should have a clear, single purpose. If it's not essential for a basic pannable/zoomable isometric grid, it doesn't belong in the MVP.**

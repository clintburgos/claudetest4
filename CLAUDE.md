# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is a newly initialized repository with no project structure or code yet. When starting work here:

1. First determine the project type and requirements from the user
2. Initialize the appropriate project structure based on the chosen technology stack
3. Set up necessary configuration files and dependencies
4. Create appropriate directory structure for source code and tests

## Development Guidelines

Since this is an empty repository, there are no existing commands or architecture to document yet. Future updates to this file should include:

- Build, test, and lint commands once a project is initialized
- Project architecture and structure once established
- Key development workflows specific to the chosen technology stack

## Claude Code Principles

- Always perform web research to ensure the best, correct approach to solving problems
- Double-check assumptions and draw from prior existing projects
- Verify functionality via comprehensive test cases
- Adopt a test-first development approach
- Follow design principles such as isolation and single responsibility
- Avoid code duplication, except in areas likely to diverge in future edits
